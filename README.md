Some things I needed to install on my computer include python3, pip, virtualenv, flask, yarn, nodejs, npm. <br> <br>

Created Flask API under api folder called api.py <br>
Created React file under src folder called App.js <br>
<br>

Notes:
To create a new Python Virtual Environment called venv: python -m venv venv <br>

To activate venv: source venv/bin/activate <br> <br>

To run Flask backend:
In one terminal, go into /api folder and do 'flask run' <br> <br>

To run react frontend:
In another terminal, go int0 react-flask-app and do 'yarn start-api'
