Some things I needed to install on my computer include python3, pip, virtualenv, flask, yarn, nodejs, npm.

Created Flask API under api folder called api.py
Created React file under src folder called App.js

Notes:
To create a new Python Virtual Environment called venv: python -m venv venv

To activate venv: source venv/bin/activate

To run Flask backend:
In one terminal, go into /api folder and do 'flask run'

To run react frontend:
In another terminal, go int0 react-flask-app and do 'yarn start-api'
